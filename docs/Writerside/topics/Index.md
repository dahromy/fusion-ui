# Introduction

This resource provides a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components.
These components are open source and can be directly copied and pasted into your applications.

Please note that this is **NOT** a traditional component library.
Unlike typical libraries, you don't need to install it as a dependency, and it's not distributed via composer.

Instead, you can select the components that suit your needs, copy the code, and paste it into your project.
You can then customize the components as per your requirements.
The code is entirely yours to use and modify.

_Consider this resource as a reference or a starting point to build your own component libraries._
